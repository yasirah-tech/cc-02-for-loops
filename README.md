# Code Challenge: For Loops

## Instructions

2. Clone down this assignment to your `code-challenges' directory in AWS Cloud9.  
3. Code your solution using JavaScript in `index.js`. 
4. **Be sure to run and test your code throughly!**
5. By the end of Code Challenge, **commit and push your changes up to Github**.
6. Using the browser, verify that your solution is in your remote repo on Github.

## Code Problems

1. Write a function named `countToTen` that console.logs all the integers from 1 to 10. 

2. Write a function named `countFromOne` that takes in an integer argument, and console.logs all the integers from 1 up to the given integer. 

3. Write a function named `countEveryEven` that takes in an integer argument, and console.logs all the *even* integers from 1 up to the given integer, including the given integer. 
```
countEveryEven(10) // logs 2 4 6 8 10
```

4. Write a function named `countEveryOdd` that takes in an integer argument, and console.logs all the *odd* integers from 1 up to the given integer, including the given integer. 
```
countEveryOdd(10) // logs 1 3 5 7 9
```

### Bonus 
6. Write a fucntion named `countEvens` that takes in an array of integers and returns the number of integers in the array that are even numbers. 
```
countEven([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,12]) // returns 5
countEven([1,2,22,204]) // returns 3
countEven([1,3,7,17,19]) // returns 0
```
